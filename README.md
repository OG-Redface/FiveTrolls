## Installation

### Step 1: Download and Add the Resource to Your Server

1. Download the resource from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/OG-Redface/FiveTrolls/releases).
2. Extract the folder and place it inside your server's `resources` directory.


### Step 2: Add to Your `server.cfg`

1. Open your **server.cfg** file.
2. Add the following line to ensure the resource starts when the server starts:
```
ensure FiveTrolls
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Install **Badger_Discord_API**

If you want to allow command execution via **Discord Role IDs**, you'll need to install **Badger_Discord_API**:

1. Download **Badger_Discord_API** from the [official repository](https://github.com/JaredScar/Badger_Discord_API).
2. Add **Badger_Discord_API** to your server's `resources` directory.
3. Ensure **Badger_Discord_API** is started **before** FiveTrolls by adding these lines to your **server.cfg**:

```
ensure Badger_Discord_API
ensure FiveTrolls
```

> **Important**: Make sure **Badger_Discord_API** is started **before** FiveTrolls. If **Badger_Discord_API** is not installed or not running before FiveTrolls, the commands using **Role IDs** will not function correctly.

> **Note**: If you do not want to use **Role IDs**, leave the **AdminRoleID** in the config file as `"CHANGE_ME"` or empty, and only the **AdminUserID** will be used for command permissions.

## Configuration

### Step 4: Edit the `config.lua` File

```
Config = {
    -- Discord User ID for the person who can execute all commands
    -- Find your Discord User ID and replace the value below
    AdminUserID = "518911871412076547",

    -- Discord Role ID for players allowed to execute commands (requires Badger_Discord_API)
    -- If you're using Role IDs for permissions, replace the value below
    -- If you are not using Badger_Discord_API, leave as "CHANGE_ME" or empty
    AdminRoleID = "CHANGE_ME",

    -- Maximum speed limit for /restrictspeed (converted to meters per second)
    MaxSpeed = 30.0,

    -- Timer for the delay before the bomb explodes when using /blowup (in milliseconds)
    Timer = 1500,

    -- Name that will appear as the sender for admin notifications in chat
    NotificationAuthor = "[MrRedDev]",

    -- Message displayed when a player's speed is restricted
    SpeedLimiterText = "MrRedDev:\nGot yo ass ü§£\nSlow ass grandma üêå",

    -- Number of Merryweather squad cars that spawn for the /mw command
    MerryweatherSquads = 2
}
```

### Step 5: Customize the Values

* **AdminUserID**: This is your Discord User ID and allows you to execute all commands. Replace `"518911871412076547"` with your actual **Discord User ID**. To find your Discord User ID:
  1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord.
  2. Right-click your name and click "Copy ID".

* **AdminRoleID**: If you want to allow players with a specific Discord **Role ID** to execute commands, set the **AdminRoleID** to the relevant role's ID. You will need **Badger_Discord_API** installed for this to work. Leave this field as `"CHANGE_ME"` or empty if you don't want to use **Role IDs**.

* **MaxSpeed**: Define the speed limit for the `/restrictspeed` command (in meters per second). The example is set to `30.0` meters per second (approximately 67 mph).

* **Timer**: This controls the delay (in milliseconds) before the bomb explodes when using `/blowup`.
* **NotificationAuthor**: Set the name that will appear in the chat as the sender of admin notifications.
* **SpeedLimiterText**: Customize the message that is sent when a player's speed is restricted. You can use emojis and `\n` for new lines.
* **MerryweatherSquads**: Define how many Merryweather squad cars are spawned for the `/mw` command.
